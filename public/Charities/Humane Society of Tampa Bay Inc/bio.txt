Organization Mission
The Humane Society of Tampa Bay was established in 1912 and is dedicated to ending animal homelessness and providing care and comfort to companion animals in need. Our core programs include shelter and adoption of homeless dogs, cats, rabbits, and pockets pets, providing affordable veterinary care and sterilization for owned pets in our community, Trap/Neuter/Vaccinate/Return (TNVR) of free roaming cats, providing safety net programs to keep pets in their homes and providing numerous community outreach programs and services. Some of our safety net programs include: Animeals, Pet Food Assistance, low-cost vaccinations, and the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund. These programs are all designed to help keep pets in their homes and out of shelters. In 2014, our Animal Hospital received accreditation by the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), the gold standard of veterinary medicine. We were the first non-profit hospital in Florida to receive this recognition. In 2016, 2019, and 2022, we received this certification again.
